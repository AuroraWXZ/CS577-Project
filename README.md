# Data
The data are stored in the data folder, with 3 original data file: train_set, valid_set, and test_set.
The "test_set - results - JY" is the test set generated by the first part in the pipeline model.

# Models
We have two models, the end-to-end model and the pipeline model. We use BERT as the architecture for the end-to-end model which the code is stored in bert_baseline. The pipeline model consists of two sub-models, the first model is stored in "REAL-NEW-SIX FEATURES TO PD.DATAFRAME-JY.py", and the second model is in "model.py".
